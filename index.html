      <h4>Our best advice is not to worry too much about it - most modern programming languages have more similarities than differences, and Epicodus graduates often find themselves working in different languages than they studied in school.</h4>

      <h4>That said, each language has found a bit of a niche, and depending on your interests, you might be attracted to one over another. Answer the next few simple questions/prompts and we'll make a suggestion based on your answers.</h4>
