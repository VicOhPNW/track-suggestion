## Description

Creation of a suggestion tool, utilizing the tools and skills learned in weeks 1-2 of of Epicodus' Intro to Programming course, to help future Epicodus students determine which path they may want to take.

## Setup/Installation Requirements

There are no installation requirements.

To use, answer the survey questions and click "Reveal my path!" to reveal a result.

## Known Bugs
Based on the errors showing in dev tools, I am running into an issue with the DOM or there are issues starting at line 137 of the index.html file. As a result, no results are revealed upon clicking the button.
