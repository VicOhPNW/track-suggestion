#### _Week 2, Friday Independent Project for Epicodus. August 3, 2018. Last updated 8/15/18_

#### By _**Victoria Oh**_

## Description
A path suggestion tool to help someone determine which path/language they may want to take.

This project was an independent exercise to apply and utilize the tools and concepts learned in weeks 1-2 of of Epicodus' Intro to Programming course. Project objectives:
* jQuery is used to show and hide the result.
* All previous standards (last week's objectives) are in place (see below).
* Site uses branching to return the result.
* Form gathers input from the user.
* Variable names are descriptive of what they represent.
* Web page is styled using Bootstrap and custom CSS.
* The project is in a presentable, portfolio-quality state.
* Required functionality is in place by the Friday deadline.
* Project demonstrates understanding of concepts covered this week. If prompted, you are able to discuss your code with an instructor using correct terminology.


## Setup/Installation Requirements

2. Open the index.html file in a web browser to view.
3. To use, answer the survey questions and click "Reveal my path!" to reveal a result.

## Known Bugs
The program will not show a result for all possible outcome combinations. This is expected as it was built to showcase understanding of the concepts learned during the week.
